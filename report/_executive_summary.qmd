[FinlyWealth](https://finlywealth.com/) is an affiliate marketing platform offering cashback on financial products, now expanding into e-commerce with a broader product catalog. To support this transition, a team of Master of Data Science students from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) is developing a scalable, multimodal product search engine. 

Our hybrid retrieval strategy combines CLIP-based embeddings [@openaiclip] with FAISS indexing [@faiss] for efficient, large-scale similarity search. The system comprises a Streamlit frontend [@streamlit], a Flask API backend [@flask], and a vector store for embeddings. We will evaluate performance by recall@K, query latency, and human relevance judgments. The final prototype will deliver intelligent product discovery beyond traditional keyword matching.
