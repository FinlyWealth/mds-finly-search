FinlyWealth, an affiliate marketing platform offering cashback on financial products, is expanding into e-commerce with a broader product catalog. To support this transition, a team of Master of Data Science students from the University of British Columbia is developing a fast, scalable product search engine with multimodal semantic capabilities. The system will support both text and image-based queries using a hybrid retrieval strategy that combines lexical (TF-IDF) and semantic (CLIP) models, indexed via FAISS for efficient large-scale search.
The dataset includes over 15 million product images and metadata entries. Given the datasetâ€™s size and complexity, the project involves rigorous data preprocessing, vector storage optimization, and performance tuning. A user-friendly frontend, backend API, and similarity engine will form the core architecture. Success will be evaluated through recall@K, latency, and human feedback. The final deliverable will be a working prototype demonstrating robust, intelligent product retrieval at e-commerce scale.
