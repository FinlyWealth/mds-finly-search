[FinlyWealth](https://finlywealth.com/) is an affiliate marketing platform offering cashback on financial products, now expanding into e-commerce with a broader product catalog. To support this transition, a team of Master of Data Science students from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) is developing a scalable, multimodal product search engine. The system will support both text and image-based queries using a hybrid retrieval strategy that leverages models like CLIP [@openaiclip], with embeddings indexed via FAISS [@faiss] for efficient large-scale retrieval.

Challenges include encoding diverse product data and defining a unified similarity metric across modalities. The architecture consists of a user-friendly Streamlit frontend, a Flask backend API, and a similarity engine. Success will be evaluated using recall@K, latency, and manual relevance assessments. The final deliverable will be a functional prototype capable of understanding both textual and visual user intentâ€”moving beyond traditional keyword search to enable intelligent e-commerce product discovery.
