As FinlyWealth expands from personal finance into e-commerce, they face the challenge of building a product search experience that can scale across a diverse and rapidly growing catalog. To support this transition, a team of Master of Data Science students from the University of British Columbia is developing a machine learning-powered search engine capable of handling both text and image queries.

Search in the e-commerce domain is uniquely difficult due to inconsistent metadata, varied product categories, and the need to interpret nuanced user intent—such as “pants under $100” or image-based queries. The current system relies on basic keyword matching, lacking semantic understanding, multimodal input support, and performance benchmarking at scale.

To address these gaps, this project will implement a semantic search engine that fuses text and image embeddings, providing accurate and flexible retrieval for a multimillion-item catalog.

### Objective

Design and implement a fast, scalable search system with multimodal capabilities. Architecture components include:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit for interactive text and image queries [@streamlit]
- **Backend API**: Flask for query handling and embedding generation [@flask]
- **Similarity Engine**: FAISS for approximate nearest neighbor search [@faiss]
- **Vector Store**: PostgreSQL or equivalent for embedding storage and metadata

Over eight weeks, we will iterate on the prototype in collaboration with FinlyWealth. Success metrics include:

- Recall@K for retrieval accuracy
- Latency for query responsiveness
- Manual relevance assessments for qualitative validation
