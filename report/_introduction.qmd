As FinlyWealth expands from personal finance into e-commerce, they face the challenge of building a product search experience that can scale across a diverse and rapidly growing catalog. To support this transition, a team of Master of Data Science students from the University of British Columbia is developing a machine learning-powered search engine capable of handling both text and image queries.

Search in the e-commerce domain is uniquely difficult due to inconsistent metadata, varied product categories, and the need to interpret nuanced user intent—such as “pants under $100” or image-based queries. The current system relies on basic keyword matching, lacking semantic understanding, multimodal input support, and performance benchmarking at scale.

To address these limitations, the project will implement a multimodal, semantic search engine that combines text and image embeddings to enable more accurate and flexible retrieval.

### Objective

The goal is to design and implement a fast, scalable search system with multimodal semantic capabilities. The architecture will include a user-friendly Streamlit [@streamlit] frontend, a Flask [@flask] based backend API, a similarity computation engine, and a vector-aware database for efficient retrieval.

Developed over an 8-week timeline in collaboration with FinlyWealth, the system’s success will be evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative metrics. These include recall@K for retrieval accuracy, latency for inference speed, and manual evaluation to assess the relevance of search results. The final deliverable will be a working prototype capable of intelligent, scalable product retrieval across a multimillion-item catalog.
