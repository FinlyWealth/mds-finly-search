Due to the dataset’s size, we plan to start early to ensure sufficient time for optimization, as shown in @fig-timeline.

- **Week 1:** Develop the initial pipeline, finalize the project proposal, and complete the necessary exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Week 2:** Focus on developing and integrating the core components locally, including the user interface, API, and data processing pipeline, to ensure smooth local operation before cloud deployment.
- **Week 3:** Process the full dataset on the cloud, connect the frontend with the backend, and explore the impact of advanced NLP techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER).
- **Week 4:** Begin performance testing and refinements, focusing on internal demos and retrieval benchmarks.
- **By Week 6 (before June 9):** Deliver a runnable draft to our mentor for review and final presentation preparation, ensuring it fully meets our capstone partner’s requirements.
- **Final Presentation:** Scheduled for June 12 or 13. We will then have 10 days to finalize the product and report, aiming for final submission by **June 26 (Week 8)**.

We acknowledge the project’s complexity and will adjust the timeline as needed, except for hard submission deadlines.
