Given the large size of the dataset, we anticipate that refinements and optimization will require substantial time; therefore, we plan to begin as early as possible. In Week 1, we will develop the initial pipeline, finalize the project proposal, and complete the necessary exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Week 2 will focus on developing the core components locally, including the user interface, API, and pipeline integration. In Week 3, we will process the full dataset on the cloud and integrate all components, while also exploring the impact of advanced NLP techniques.

In Week 4, we will initiate performance testing and begin iterative refinements. By Week 6 (before June 9), we aim to deliver a runnable draft to our mentor, with the final presentation scheduled for June 12 or 13. The final product and report will be completed by June 26 (Week 8).

We acknowledge the complexity of this project and plan to experiment with a range of techniques. Apart from hard submission deadlines, the timeline will remain flexible to accommodate progress.
