#### Data Source, Description and Cleaning          

The dataset consists of multimodal product data, including images (14,684,588 JPEG files, approximately 67 GB), textual information (product names and descriptions), and structured metadata (e.g., `Category`, `Brand`, `Color`). The metadata is stored in a 12 GB CSV file containing 15,384,100 rows and 30 columns.

After conducting exploratory data analysis and consulting with our partner, we selected the 16 most relevant columns that capture the key information users care about. We excluded non-English market entries—retaining approximately 70% of the dataset—in line with our partner’s business focus. Additionally, we merged the `Brand` and `Manufacturer` columns into a single `MergedBrand` field to reduce duplication while preserving distinct brand information. We chose to ignore missing values in the metadata columns, as these fields are likely to provide supplementary information, while the product name already contains the primary details.
