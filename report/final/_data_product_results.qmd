<!-- ## Data Product

The FinlyWealth Product Search Engine is a sophisticated multimodal retrieval system designed to increase product discovery in e-commerce environments. This data product addresses the fundamental challenge of enabling users to find relevant products from vast catalogs using natural language queries and visual inputs, processing over 1 million products with sub-200ms response times.

## Why This Product Exists

Finly's credit card search systems sufferred from several critical limitations:

-   **Keyword Dependency**: Users search must contain keywords in the actual product and should not have spelling errors
-   **Limited Semantic Understanding**: Inability to interpret user intent beyond literal matches
-   **Visual Search Gap**: No capability to search using images or visual similarity

### Strategic Value Proposition

To solve the afore mentioned issues, we developed a Search Engine to:

1.  **Enable Intuitive Discovery**: Allow users to search using natural language descriptions like "comfortable running shoes for winter" rather than exact product specifications
2.  **Bridge Visual-Textual Gap**: Support image-based queries where users can upload photos to find similar products
3.  **Improve Conversion Rates**: Deliver more relevant results through AI-powered understanding of user intent
4.  **Scale Efficiently**: Handle millions of products while maintaining fast response times
5.  **Competitive Differentiation**: Provide advanced search capabilities that set FinlyWealth apart in the affiliate marketing space

### Product Interface Architecture

### Preprocessing Pipeline

The system employs a sophisticated data preprocessing pipeline consisting of several key scripts:

#### 1. Embedding Generation

-   **Purpose**: Converts product text and images into high-dimensional vector representations
-   **Models Used**:
    -   CLIP (`openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`) [@openaiclip] for multimodal embeddings
    -   MiniLM (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) [@Wang2020MiniLMDS] for text-specific embeddings
-   **Output**: Fusion embeddings combining both text and image understanding

#### 2. FAISS Index Construction

-   **Purpose**: Creates optimized vector search indices for fast similarity retrieval
-   **Technology**: Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) [@faiss] with IVF clustering

#### 3. Database Loading

-   **Purpose**: Populates PostgreSQL database with product metadata and embeddings
-   **Features**: Utilizes pgvector extension for native vector operations -->

#### Frontend Interface

The Streamlit-based [@streamlit] frontend provides an intuitive user experience:

**Key Features:** 
- **Multimodal Input**: Supports both text queries and image uploads

- **Rich Results Display**: Product cards with images, prices, and detailed metadata 

- **Analytics Dashboard**: Live statistics on search results including price ranges, brand distribution, category breakdowns and LLM reasoning 

- **User Experience Design:** 
  - Progressive result loading (20 results initially, expandable) 
  - Visual feedback for user interactions (Precision)

#### Backend API

The Flask-based [@flask] REST API serves as the core processing engine:

**Endpoints:** 

- `POST /api/search`: Main search functionality supporting text, image, and multimodal queries 

- `GET /api/ready`: Health check and initialization status 
 
- `POST /api/feedback`: User feedback collection for continuous improvement

**Query Workflow:**

**(Insert diagram of the query workflow)**

Our processing pipeline initiates with *Query Analysis* to determine the input type, whether text, image, or a combination. This is followed by *Embedding Generation*, which creates appropriate vector representations. Next, a *Hybrid Retrieval* step combines both vector similarity and full-text search for comprehensive results. Subsequently, *LLM Reranking*, utilizing models like OpenAI GPT or Google Gemini, optimizes the relevance of the retrieved information. Finally, Result Formatting structures the output, incorporating essential metadata and analytics.

### Strengths and Limitations

#### Key Advantages

1.  **Multimodal Capability**: Unique ability to process both text and image queries simultaneously
2.  **Hybrid Search Architecture**: Combines vector similarity with traditional full-text search for improved recall
3.  **Scalable Design**: FAISS indices enable sub-second search across millions of products
4.  **Flexible Model Integration**: Supports multiple embedding models and LLM providers

#### Technical Constraints

1.  **Model Dependencies**: Relies on pre-trained models that may not be domain-specific. No training done
2.  **Memory Requirements**: Large embedding matrices require significant RAM and storage for optimal performance
3.  **Single-Language Support**: Currently optimized only for English queries
4.  **Update Propagation**: Adding new products requires recomputing embeddings and rebuilding indices

### Potential Improvements and Implementation Challenges

In the upcoming iteration of the product, the following can be explored:

#### 1. Advanced Keyword Extraction with KeyBERT

- **Improvement**: Implement KeyBERT for automatic keyword extraction to enrich text embeddings. This was explored and improved the recall score
- **Benefits**: Better understanding of product attributes and user intent 
- **Implementation Challenge**: Requires additional compute resources for keyword processing

#### 2. Premium Embedding Models

- **Improvement**: Upgrade to OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large or similar high-performance models 
- **Benefits**: Superior semantic understanding and cross-domain generalization 
- **Implementation Challenge**: Significantly higher API costs and embedding size

#### 3. LLM Prompt Engineering with Real Customer Data

- **Improvement**: Develop sophisticated prompts using actual user search patterns and feedback 
- **Benefits**: More contextually aware result reranking 
- **Implementation Challenge**: Privacy concerns and data collection complexity

#### 4. Managed Vector Database Migration

- **Improvement**: Transition to Pinecone or similar managed vector database services 
- **Benefits**: Reduced operational overhead, better scalability, advanced features 
- **Implementation Challenge**: Migration complexity and ongoing costs 
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Higher operational costs but reduced engineering overhead
