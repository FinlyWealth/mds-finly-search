### Definitions  {.unnumbered}
**CLIP:** Generates embeddings for both text and images, mapping them into a shared embedding space. We are not training any embedding model, instead we use off-the-shelf [CLIP models](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/clip) to generate embeddings.

**Embedding Generation:** The preprocessed query is then transformed into a numerical representation (an embedding) that captures its semantic meaning.

**FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library that allows developers to quickly search for embeddings of multimedia documents.Enables efficient approximate nearest neighbor search over embeddings.

**TF-IDF:** A numerical statistic used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document within a collection of documents
