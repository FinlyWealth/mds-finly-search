[FinlyWealth](https://finlywealth.com/) is an affiliate marketing platform that rewards customers for applying for financial products. It is now looking to expand its business by offering e-commerce products through its platform. To support this transition, a team of [Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) students from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) has developed a fast and scalable multimodal search engine that allows users to search using text, images, or both, to find the most relevant products. The final product delivers product discovery by leveraging semantic understanding, enabling more accurate and relevant search results beyond simple keyword matching.

Our retrieval pipeline combines multimodal CLIP [@openaiclip] embeddings with text-only MiniLM [@huggingfaceMinilm] embeddings, indexing them using FAISS [@faiss] for efficient large-scale similarity search. At query time, the system identifies semantically relevant products by retrieving similar items from the index and then applies an LLM-based [@openai2023gpt35] reranking module to refine the ranking. The architecture consists of a Streamlit [@streamlit] frontend, a Flask-based [@flask] API backend, and a vector database[@pgvector] that supports embedding-based retrieval. The system effectively handles complex natural language and multimodal queries, a common challenge in e-commerce search. Quantitatively, we observed a Recall@20 of 0.56, Precision@20 of 0.64, and an average query time of 4.24 seconds over a dataset of one million products. Our data product provides a reproducible pipeline that allows FinlyWealth to index new items, evaluate system performance, and support semantic search for future e-commerce offerings.
