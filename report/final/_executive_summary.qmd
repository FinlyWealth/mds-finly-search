[FinlyWealth](https://finlywealth.com/) is an affiliate marketing platform that rewards customers for applying for financial products. It is now looking to expand its business by offering e-commerce products through its platform. To support this transition, a team of Master of Data Science students from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) is developing a fast and scalable multimodal search engine that allows users to search using text, images, or both, to find the most relevant products. The final product delivers advanced product discovery by leveraging semantic understanding, enabling more accurate and relevant search results beyond simple keyword matching.

Our hybrid retrieval strategy combines CLIP-based [@openaiclip] and MiniLM [@huggingfaceMinilm] embeddings with FAISS indexing [@faiss] for efficient large-scale similarity search. After retrieval, we leverage an LLM-based reranking module to reorder the candidates, ensuring that the most relevant products are ranked at the top. The system consists of a Streamlit frontend [@streamlit], a Flask API backend [@flask], and a vector store for embedding-based retrieval. We evaluate the systemâ€™s performance using Recall@20, Precision@20 based on human relevance judgments, and query time. Our results show a Recall@20 of 0.56, Precision@20 of 0.64, and an average search time of 4.24 seconds over a dataset of one million products.
