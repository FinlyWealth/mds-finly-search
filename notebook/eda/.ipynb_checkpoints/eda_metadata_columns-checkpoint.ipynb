    "Now, as we can see, the main reason a product name doesn't include the brand is that many of those products simply lack brand information.

    "Including the brand in the text embeddings could be helpful, especially for edge cases where the product name is vague or uninformative (as shown below). While we may not see a significant boost in overall accuracy, adding brand information could enhance model performance in such scenarios."

    "### Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "It appears that most used items are books, music-related products, or games. While incorporating the Condition field into text embeddings could potentially improve search accuracy for used books and similar items, it is not considered essential. Instead, we prefer to treat it as a post-search filtering criterion."

    "## Metadata Columns Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a summary of metadata columns and whether they will be included in the text embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅MergedBrand:** This will be included in the text embeddings. While most product names already contain brand information, explicitly embedding it can help in edge cases where the product name is ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅Category:** After incorporating category into text embeddings, we observed some improved search results—e.g., the query \"Furniture\" no longer returns books. However, since 37% of products lack category information and the complexity of categories, we may consider enriching the category manually. For now, including category has already shown positive impact in certain scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅Gender:** Although product images can sometimes convey gender information, having explicit gender data is helpful for items where the image alone is ambiguous about the gender—such as watches or rings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌Condition:** Most used items are books, music-related products, or games. As confirmed with the partner, this field will not be included in the text embeddings. Instead, it will be considered for post-search filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌Size:** Due to the high cardinality of the size field and its relatively low importance in common search scenarios, this attribute will also be treated as a post-search filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌Color:** Since product images already capture color information effectively, we will not include color in the text embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️Price:** Price requires separate handling, as general-purpose models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2 are not trained to interpret or enforce numerical conditions effectively. I experimented with adding price to the text embeddings, but the model still fails to effectively capture or interpret the price information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The returned result should prioritize the category as the most important factor, followed by price, and then brand.**"
