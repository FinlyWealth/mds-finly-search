### Data source and description
The dataset comprises two primary sources: product images and metadata. The image folder contains approximately 14.68 million JPEG images, totaling 64 GB, with each image roughly sized at 100×100 pixels. Image filenames correspond to the pid (product ID) column in the metadata CSV file. While some products may have multiple associated images, we confirmed with our project partner that we will assume a 1:1 mapping—each product is linked to a single image via its PID. Notably, the number of image files (14,684,588) is slightly fewer than the number of unique product IDs (15,147,805). The metadata is stored in a 12G CSV file containing around 15 million rows, where each row represents one product listing. The file includes 30 columns covering product attributes such as pid, name, description, color, brand, price, image URL, and product link URL.

###Exploratory data analysis
Many columns in the dataset contain missing values. Approximately 91% of entries in the ShortDescription column and 99% in the Keywords column are missing. After discussion with our partner, we decided to drop both columns and use the more complete Description column instead. Other fields such as Gender, Color, and Brand also have a significant proportion of missing values. However, the most critical columns for our project—such as pid, Name, and Description—are largely complete, making the dataset suitable for our planned modeling and retrieval tasks.
We examined the unique values in metadata columns such as category, color, size, and brand, and found that each contains over 10,000 distinct values. These high-cardinality categorical features require careful handling when used in modeling. For instance, extremely rare values like the color "Spicy Melon" (which appears in only 0.000007% of records) may be grouped into an "Other" category to reduce noise and prevent overfitting. Additionally, we plan to add two new columns: one to standardize all prices to USD, and another to merge the "Brand" and "Manufacturer" fields to eliminate duplication and ensure consistency. We will also exclude products with currencies outside of USD, CAD, and GBP, as Finly is currently focused on English-language markets.
To better understand what users are likely to search for, we analyzed the top 30 most frequent words in product names. Common terms like “women,” “men,” and “black” appear frequently and often overlap with metadata fields such as gender and color. This raises the risk of false positives—broad matches like “goes well with black jacket” could incorrectly trigger any product containing the words “black” or “jacket.” To address this, we plan to use contextualized representations (e.g., embeddings) to better capture meaning and reduce noise. Incorporating structured metadata can further improve accuracy by grounding the model in concrete attributes.

### Data challenge
Given the large data size, we face significant challenges related to computing and storage. The product information CSV file is 12GB, which we converted to Parquet format to enable more efficient local processing. The image dataset totals 64GB, which makes local handling less feasible. To address this, we are exploring cloud computing solutions such as AWS. As an initial step, we will build and test our workflow using a randomly selected sample of 100,000 images to ensure scalability and performance before scaling up.
